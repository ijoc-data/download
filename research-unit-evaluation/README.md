This repository provides the research data for the real-world problem of parametric evaluation of Polish research units. It contains the performance of 993 research units in terms of four gain-type criteria: scientific activity (g1), scientific potential (g2), material effects of unit's activities (g3), and remaining (non-material) effects of unit's activities (g4). Each unit is assigned to one of the four classes Cl1 - Cl4 (with Cl1 and Cl4 being, respectively, the least and the most preferred ones).
